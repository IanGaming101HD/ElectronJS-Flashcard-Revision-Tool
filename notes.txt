Pretty much everything works except changing directory.

Changing directory does save the directory in a txt file.
Just need to read it so txt file can be created in that directory if it doesnt exist and create cards in that directory instead of default.
And needs to automatically read flashcards from the directory in the session code.
Also make it have a default directory in case of errors.

Also maybe instead of select folder, make it select file, so user can make their own named file with json format,
however if its not json then just create new file 'cards.json' in default directory.
